  Imagine you are part of the team working on a block based building game for the Lego company.  

  Google search for "lego brick types" for examples of the types of bricks available in Lego. There are many many types of bricks.  

  You need to come up with a heirarchy of classes to identify each brick in the game. You'll need to store some basic information for every brick - its dimensions, its colour, etc. You'll need to identify bricks that can be grouped together by their unique properties. Similarly you will need to identify the functionality each brick will have. Every brick can be rotated and moved. Some blocks have hinges, some are wheels, etc.  

  You should design and code up a class hierarchy. You should include any appropriate **member variables**, you should identify **class methods**, you don't need to fully code up the methods, you can just define them. For example a rotate method might be added to the `Block` **class** as shown below.

  ```java
  public class Block {

    public void rotate(){

    }
  }
  ```
